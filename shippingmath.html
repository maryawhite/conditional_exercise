    <dt>What does "use strict" do in JavaScript</dt>
    <dd>In strict mode you can't use undeclared variables.</dd>

    <dt>What's the benefit of using strict mode.</dt>
    <dd>If you accidentally misspell a variable name, it will result in an error. Without strict mode, it would create a brand new global variable.</dd>

    <dt>Other benefits of strict mode.</dt>
    <dd>It won't allow you to duplicate parameters or use Octal numbers, and the "this" keyword behaves differently in strict mode, plus a few other benefits.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
    <dt>What's the difference between == and === in JavaScript</dt>
    <dd>= is the assignment operator, == checks for equality, and === checks for type and value equality</dd>

    <dt>What is hoisting?</dt>
    <dd>When you declare a variable using "var", the variable declaration is hoisted to the top of the code, which means you could use the var before it's declared, but JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations. W3 schools recommends that you always declare your variables at the beginning of the scope. Also note that "let" and "const" behave differently. Let and Const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized. Trying to use a let variable before it is declared results in a Reference Error. Using const before it's declared is a syntax error and the code won't run. </dd>

    <dt>Other benefits of strict mode.</dt>
    <dd>It won't allow you to duplicate parameters or use Octal numbers, and the "this" keyword behaves differently in strict mode, plus a few other benefits.</dd>

    <dt>What's the difference between an undeclared and undefined variable in JavaScript?</dt>
    <dd>An undefined variable means a variable has been declared, but it doesn't have a value. An undeclared variable has not been declared and does not exist in the program. An undeclared variable will result in a Reference Error.</dd>

    <dt>What is the "this" keyword in JavaScript?</dt>
    <dd>The "this" keyword refers to the object from where it was called.</dd>

    <dt>MMM</dt>
    <dd>MMM</dd>
</dl>

    <dt>How would you convert a string to an integer in JavaScript?</dt>
    <dd>To convert a string to an integer, you can use parseInt(). It will return NaN if no number is found. If spaces are included, it will return the number before the space and omit the rest. You can optionally include a radix. To convert from decimal to binary you could use parseInt("01001", 2); where the 2 stands for base 2 which is binary. This would return 9 because the binary number 01001 equals the decimal number 9.</dd>

    <dt>What would be the result of 3 + 2 + "7"?</dt>
    <dd>"57" becuase it would add 3 & 2 and then concatenate the string number 7 and return the string 57.</dd>

    <dt>What's the difference between an alert box and a confirmation box?</dt>
    <dd>An alert box displays only one button, OK. The confirmation box displays 2 buttons, ok and cancel.</dd>

    <dt>Which keywords are used to handle exceptions?</dt>
    <dd>Try, Catch, and Finally</dd>

    <dt>What is a property in JavaScript?</dt>
    <dd>A property in JavaScript would be referring the property of an object. And you can access it using dot notation or bracket notation. So if you have a car object and the properties are make and model, you could have car.make, and car.model.</dd>
